* [ ] dynamically add/remove cars
* [ ] draw control signals as arrows
* [ ] add constant green signal (to measure lane changing model quality)
* [ ] implement IDM
* [ ] show statistics (num cars/roads/junctions, average speed/waiting time) etc
*     [ ] implement methods to measure
*     [ ] text output
*     [ ] draw graphs
* [ ] scale time
*     [ ] metric units
*     [ ] implement GUI trackbar
* [X] implement rules for turns (right -> right, left -> left)
*     [X] pick lane on the current road to perform turn
*     [X] choose left/forward/right direction and than pick lane
* [X] OOP, classes, application
* [X] Trajectory class. Contains currentLine and nextLine, allow cars to occupy 2 lanes at once
* [X] change lanes in the middle of a road
* [X] create cars
* [X] create roads
* [X] don’t go back on the junction
* [X] draw lines
* [X] flexible time intervals for the lights
* [X] get rid of getters, replace with properties
* [X] get rid of tempRoad
* [X] highlight junctions
* [X] id to objects and fix serialization (avoid references problems)
* [X] implement geometry — need Rect (as Polygon), Point, Segment, GridCell
* [X] linter
* [X] move junctions holding alt
* [X] number of lanes should be equal to the intersection length
* [X] roads should be connected to their graphical representation, draw cars exactly on the road
* [X] save roads to json
* [X] scale and scroll map
* [X] simulate movement
* [X] use storage instead of cookies + serialize/deserialize
